You go to college so that someday you can get a good job. But to get good jobs, you most likely need one or two good internships. Unfortunately, landing a good internship can be a really tough thing when you've had no prior experience! It can feel hopeless, but luckily there's a lot you can be doing right now to make your resume shine through to future employers. And habits you can be picking up that will prepare you for the interview stages.  


# **Showing up for class doesn't impress anyone. Start a project.**
Alright, you've made it into college and classes have started. You're working on a cool project in intro to computer science and making decent grades. But guess what? So is most everyone else in the class... well, except for those who are about to drop and switch to pshycology. The point is, many students go through college with the mindset that suceeding in their classes will be enough to win over employers. Unfortunately, just showing up to class and getting the work completed on time doesn't catch the attention of anyone. That's the bare minimum of what people want to see in their future employees! This means that to separate yourself out from the others, you need to go the extra mile. This means starting personal project on the side that allow you to explore certain computer science concepts you want to improve in further. This means joining in some of the available clubs in your department that will enable you to work on more developed projects and colab with others. Doing either of these options reflects drive and curiosity for what you're learning. It means that you're working on improving yourself and seeking out more than what's expected of you. And *it will* improve your skills and comfort with code in a way that will become obvious if anyone ever interviews you. They'll see that you have experience working on a team and problem solving, and they'll want to start investing in you as one of their interns!

# **Git GitHub**
I give this advice to many early computer scientists but few take it. GitHub is one of the most popular version control softwares - or to dumb it down a little for those who are new to software terms - lots of people use it to collaborate on code together! It's also the perfect place to host your code so employees or just people in the tech community can come in and see what you're working on. At first, GitHub seems really confusing, but trust me it isn't! You just need to learn the terminology and watch a video like <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s'>this</a> to know all you really need to know about it at this point in your career. I personally have a lot of fun with GitHub and even host my blog you're reading right now through it!

# **Find a good pre-internship**
After your freshman year of college, it's pretty tough to land an internship if your trying. But whether you're trying or not, you should aim to get a summer job that will still give you some sort of technology experience. If not technology experience, find one that's more business related and requires you to work on a team. I think in 100% of the behavioral interviews I've taken, I've been asked at least one question that started with "Tell me about a time you were a part of a team and ..." Sure you have group projects in school, but the testimony hits different when you were a part of a team producing real results, in a real workplace. They'll be more confident to bring you into their professional environment if you've been in another one already.

# **Practice, practice, practice**
I'll be a hypocrite saying this, but if I could go back, I would've started practicing for the technical interviews right after I took Data Structures and Algorithms. That class is like the golden gateway into internship eligibility in employers' eyes, and keeping up with those concepts are crucial to succeeding in most any interview, whether for an internship or for your future job. I know several of my friends have used LeetCode when preparing for Microsoft and Google interviews. I also went through a book called "Cracking the Coding Interview" that was in my department library. Definitely reach out to your advisor or professors for additional resources. I'm sure they'll have many and be impressed that you're seeking it out. They'll also be more happy to leave a good review on your student evaluation form most companies ask you for.

# **Actually put time into the resume**
A couple peices of advice with this. First, use key words in your resume, the key words that word scanners will pick up and move on to human eyes. Companies can't spend time reading each line of every applicant's resume, so write with the machine's eye in mind first. "Leadership, automate, developer, innovate" are all great words that will help move your pdf along.
Once your resume does make it to human eyes, then I personally belive that if your personal information is the HTML, your resume is the CSS. Make yourself look good not just by what you have accomplished, but your visual presentation of it. Clean, logically ordered, precise resumes will appeal to employers wanting an orderly, logical future employee. And it will allow them to know who you are with a quick scan if you've done it right.
Finally, I suggest you find one or two professors in your department to read over your resume and critique it. Yes, I know that's scary having someone point out all the flaws in your resume, but better them than the employer who will just send the "we're honored you applied but there were more qualified applicants" email. These professors most likely have had experience being the employer who goes through resumes, and they'll know exactly how employers will be reacting to you. Highly highly recommend!


All that being said, I wish all of you the best of luck as you begin searching for internships! Be daring with where you apply, find places whose missions intrigue you, and be able to get rejected many times! It can be like a game, but if you play it right, it can be a lot of fun landing an internship and further pursuing your passions.
