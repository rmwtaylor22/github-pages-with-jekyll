title: "Why Computer Science Needs Creatives"

When you hear the words "computer science", what do you think of? 1's and 0's? Wires and code? An Einstein-looking man sitting in a dark back corner of the computer lab typing the day away?

In its essence, computer science is a very technical field with yes, 1's and 0's and many people who perform intensive coding to develop elegant algorithms. Without logical, analytical, and systematically thinking people, computer science wouldn't survive. And those are the kind of people who gravitate and are expected to comprise the majority of the field. But another people group are beginning to grow in the field - creatives.

# **The Mouse and the Pointer Finger**
Expecting the average user to know how work with a complex computer machine would be crazy. Instead, the user is given an interface. Within that interface are several symbols, pictures, and visual patterns that indicate how the user can pass along certain instructions. The most basic example is the computer "mouse" which shows up on the screen through a small pointer finger, indicating its role in selecting elements on the screen. Then you have the mail icon that promises to reveal your email inbox, the downward-facing carrot which indicates a hidden dropdown of information, and the "x" at the top right of each "tab" that will close out of the current view. If you think about it, the way we interact with computers is *heavily* abstracted. It's all visual, and each little detail matters a whole lot.

Visuals impact how long a user stays on a website. They can either help or hinder a user in knowing how to complete a certain task. They can add identitiy to a site, or distraction. Did you know that 70% of online shoppers abandon their carts because of poor UX? A good user interface can raise website conversion rates by up to 200% (Selma, 2021).

And as technology advances, the relevance of pristine visual aesthetics only grows with it. Virtual reality is just on the cusp of its potential in providing people a totally new world to live in through putting on electronic goggles and giving people new eyes. While incredibly technical minds were needed to create such a device, how much stronger were the creative minds who were tasked with creating a visually believable, 360 degree world?


# **Employers changing their standards**

My sophmore year of college I went to a job fair. No joke - my resume had a picture of me on it, surrounded by a pink, flowery border. Then I added splashes of yellow in other areas of my page because I loved the pink-yellow combo. After booking an interview with a space defense company, I confidently walked into the interview room with one of the company's VP's and laid my vibrant resume down on his desk. He looked at it long, and then smiled. His free hand moved to his other stack of resumes, and he spread them out in one swoop.

"Well, this looks a bit different from the rest."

I smiled. "Yeah... I was wanting to highlight that I have an artistic eye that comes along with my computer science."

"I can see that. Now, you know what we do right?"

I was nervous when he said this because I started feeling a little out of place. A design-oriented thinker among an engineering-heavy company? "Yes, space defense. I doubted whether or not I should sign up for this interview, but got encouragement to still talk with you."

"No that's okay," he said. "I know someone who does some visual work for us. I'll pass your resume along to him."

To be honest, I had no hope for that role. I began talking with another company that was going to offer me a position in Indianapolis working with client to improve their user interfaces. I was excited for this position because it was completely centered around visuals, but was a little dissapointed because I wouldn't be coding as much. I still wanted to grow in my programming abilities!

But one fateful day, I recieved an enthusiastic phone call from the space defense company! The man on the other end enthusiastically told me how my interests aligned with his, and how special it was to be gifted in both design and code! "Oh Rose, we've got the perfect job for you over here, and you'll be able to use your design skills just as much as your coding! Honstly, we need a lot more people like you."

I was shocked - I never felt so valued for my passions! Realizing how committed they were to integrating my design interests with my programming interests, I took the job! And the encouragement didn't stop there - at the end of my internship, each intern gave a presentation on what they accomplished that summer. At the end of my presentation, the man who originally interviewed me for the position stood up and addressed everyone in the room, saying,
"When I interviewed Rose, she explained to me how she was interested in pursuing both computer science AND digital media. And even though her course work leans more artistically, she had one of the best interviews out of all her other classmates who had straight CS degrees! And I'm thinking our company could use more diverse skillsets like this. We need to start changing our hiring strategy."

I think I almost cried! Here was the VP at a hard core engineering company admitting that they needed to bring on more visually-creative minds! I never felt more affirmed in my passions.

Computer science does tend to work well for those who have visual minds in general because it means you're more likely to be detail oriented and catch faults in the code or visual outcome fast. It seems like companies more and more are realizing this, and growing specifically their design teams to meet the visual needs of their users. The fields of User Experience (UX) Design and User Interface (UI) Design are growing rapidly in the tech industry as we can see by the graph below:

# **Not Fakin' Anything**
There's a lighthearted joke in my computer science department at school that the Computer Science and Digital Media majors are the fake computer scientists. Even though I know  that my peers who say it are just trying to pull our strings and maybe get back at us for getting to skip the really hard classes, it still feels a little demoralizing some days. But I can confidently say that our skillset is crucial to the structure and maintanence of computer science. And I believe the need for creatives will only keep trending upwards.
