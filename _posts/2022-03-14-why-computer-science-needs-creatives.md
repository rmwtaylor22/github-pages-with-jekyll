When you hear the words "computer science", what do you think of? 1's and 0's? Wires and code? An Einstein-looking man sitting in a dark back corner of the computer lab typing the day away?

In its essence, computer science is a very technical field with yes, 1's and 0's and many people who perform intensive coding to develop elegant algorithms. Without logical, analytical, and systematically thinking people, computer science wouldn't survive. And those are the kind of people who gravitate and are expected to comprise the majority of the field. But another people group are beginning to grow in the field - creatives.

As computers were taking off and the home computer was growing in populartiy, the need for a more user-friendly system arose.


# **Employers changing their standards**

My sophmore year of college I went to a job fair. No joke - my resume had a picture of me on it, surrounded by a pink, flowery border. Then I added splashes of yellow in other areas of my page because I loved the pink-yellow combo. After booking an interview with a space defense company, I confidently walked into the interview room with one of the company's VP's and laid my vibrant resume down on his desk. He looked at it long, and then smiled. His free hand moved to his other stack of resumes, and he spread them out in one swoop.
"Well this looks a bit different from the rest."
I smiled. "Yeah... I was wanted to highlight that I have an artistic edge that comes along with my computer science."
