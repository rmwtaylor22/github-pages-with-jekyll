title: "How I Accidentally Became a Computer Scientist"

My origin story in computer science is an unlikely one, seeing as I wrote in my 7th grade journal that “Cumputers” was my worst subject and “Art” was my best.

Going into Junior year of high school I believed I’d end up in one of two places in life: working as a digital artist, since it was always my best subject, or in a lab as a biochemist, since I thought biology was cool and my dad said a straight biology degree wasn’t practical (to all bio majors reading this, I apologize and will defer your questions to my father). 

Wanting to get a head start on biochemistry, I signed up to take Chemistry II as an “alpha class” at DePauw University my junior year. (Alpha classes basically just let high school students take a college course but it’s spread out across an entire year.) While I was doing so, though, fate had me take notice of bolder letters indicating there was a NEW alpha class being offered this year, by the name of “Advanced Computer Languages and Technologies”. 

I carelessly agreed to make it my "back-up option," but little did I know that the class had only three other people sign up for it. And since I guess the professor wanted as many people in there to validate the class’s existence, I was tossed in there too, despite my first request for chemistry. 

When I learned what had happened, I was shocked and said goodbye to getting a head start to the career field of my practical dreams.


# **Hello World 101**

The first day of class I had no idea what to expect. Whether we were learning a new software or how to build a physical computer, I wouldn’t know more than I’d know the difference between a bit and a byte. The teacher introduced it as a “Java coding course,” whatever that voodoo language meant. And unfortunately the whole class felt like learning voodoo. 

I always felt lost, dumb, and daydreamy in that class. In any other class, I was a straight-A student, but when I stepped into that dream-crushing, dank computer lab, I'd recieved multiple C's and D's on the reading quizzes because I never truly comprehending what I had read the night before. Oh, and our year long project of creating a computer game of Crazy Eights? My prof litterally sat by my side and told me what to do each step of the way. It was funny, he'd try so hard to help me figure it out by asking questions to lead me in the right path. I'd still have not a clue, and by the end of each class he'd be there telling me exactly what to type and on what line.


"Well, at least now I have a deeper respect for people who do that full time" I told my friends, not wanting to believe my time in that class was wasted.

Little did I know, it was not wasted at all.

# **Choosing a Major can be Hard**

As I began really trying to nail down what I wanted to study in college, my dad suggested I browse the majors offered by my favorite colleges. Originally I was looking at the life sciences and graphic design courses. I even toyed with going into communications. 

As I was looking through Taylor University's site since my older three siblings had gone there, I came across the major "Computer Science and Digital Media." I was intrigued because it involved art, and I wondered how it could be combined with coding. 

I visited the University twice and found myself curious and excited to learn more after sitting in on the computer science lectures. They presented the ideas in an engaing and understandable way for me. Then I talked with the prof (my future advisor) who got the dual major of computer science and digital media going at Taylor, and I was so inspired by his passion for building creative solutions and designs all in one! I was also able to talk to current students who's passions seemed to align with mine.

Before I knew it, I was convinced that computer scinece and digital media was the major made in heaven for me! I strongly disliked that first computer science class in high school, but believed that Taylor University would help me like it. 

Yeah I know, seems risky. But I committed to Taylor University fall of my senior year, and the rest was history!

# **On The Road to... Success?**

In my four years here, I've been amazed at how much I've grown from my classes in such a short amount of time! I've been able to make a 3-D rendered animation of Disney's Small World Clock, as well as create an HTTP server from scratch. 

Still, I doubted my choice of major more times than I'd like to admit... literally at the end of my junior year, I was dispairing because I was struggling so hard in my data communications class and was convinced I chose the wrong major once more. But I believe now that it's the best major for me. Not because I'm quick to understand computer science concepts - trust me, it's always taken me a while to learn something new. Instead, the major plays to my strengths in analytical thinking and visual design. And computer science is such a large career field! I can use my current knowledge of coding and computers to accomplish projects in so many areas I'm passionate about - and can use my broad set of skills to branch out to other occupations in the future!

So yes, I somehow made it through a rocky road of becoming a computer scientist. I'm glad I made it here, and I certainly have a long road ahead of me of learning the field more. But I'm excited to be traveling it and seeing what destinations lie ahead!
