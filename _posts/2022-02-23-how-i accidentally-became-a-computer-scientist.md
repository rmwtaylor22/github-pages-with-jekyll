![Rose as a little girl 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmwtaylor22/github-pages-with-jekyll/main/_posts/IMG_8943.JPG "I was destined for computer science at a young age.")

In 6th grade, I wrote in my pink, sparkly diary that “Cumputers” was my worst subject and “Art” was my best. All I can say is, my origin story in computer science was an unlikely one.

Going into Junior year of high school, I started considering what to study in college. I envisioned myself ending up in one of two places after graduation: working as a digital artist or some sort of laboratory scienctist. Art has been my forte for as long as I can remember. It's through designing or creating things that I've always found my "flow" in work. But I wasn't convinced that doing art full-time was practical, so since biology was cool and my dad was a scientist, biology or chemistry were my practical choices for future study.

Being the practical thinker I am, I wanted to get a head start on my science experience while still in high school. In pursuit of this, I signed up to take Chemistry II as an “alpha class” at DePauw University during my junior year (alpha classes let high school students take a slower-paced college course that extends throughout the entire year). While I was filling out the form, though, fate had me take interest of bolder letters at the bottom of the page indicating there was a NEW alpha class being offered that year by the name of “Advanced Computer Languages and Technologies”. *Hmmm.*

I carelessly agreed to make it my "back-up option" and turned in the form. Little did I know that the class had only three other people sign up for it, and since the professor wanted as many people in there to validate the class’s existence, I was tossed in there too. 

I was shocked to learn what had happened and said goodbye to getting a head start to the career field of my practical dreams.


# **Hello World 101**

The first day of class I had no idea what to expect. Whether we were learning a new software or how to build a physical computer, I wouldn’t know more than I’d know the difference between a bit and a byte. The teacher introduced it as a “Java coding course,” whatever that voodoo language meant. And unfortunately the whole class really seemed to me like  voodoo. 

Each class, I felt lost, dumb, and a little daydreamy as my professor droned on about functions, parameters, and object-oriented programming. In any other class, I was a straight-A student, but when I stepped into that dank college computer lab at 8am, I'd recieved multiple C's and D's on the reading quizzes because I never truly comprehended what I had read the night before. 

Fun fact: we had a year long project of creating a computer game of Crazy Eights, and my prof litterally sat by my side and told me what to do each step of the way. It was sadly humorous - he'd try so hard to help me figure it out by asking questions that hinted towards the right path. I'd still be clueless though, and by the end of each class he'd be sitting there telling me exactly what to type and on what line.

"Well, at least now I have a deeper respect for people who do that full time" I told my friends, not wanting to believe my time in that class was wasted.

Little did I know, it was not wasted at all.

# **Choosing a Major can be Hard**

As I began really trying to nail down what I wanted to study in college, my dad suggested I browse the majors offered by my favorite colleges. One of these colleges, Taylor University, caught my attention when I came across the major "Computer Science and Digital Media." It involved the study of artistic design, scientific thinking, and videography. Even though computer science and coding still had a bad taste in my mouth, this major sounded intriguingly fun! 

I visited the University twice and each time found myself curious to learn more after sitting in on the computer science lectures. The professors presented new ideas in an engaging and understandable way for me. I also met with the professor who founded the major of "Computer Science and Digital Media" at Taylor and found myself inspired by his passion for building creative solutions through design! I wanted to be like that!

And before I knew it, I was fully convinced that computer scinece and digital media was the major made in heaven for me! Sure, I strongly disliked my first experience with computer science, but I believed that Taylor University would help me like it. And with that, I enrolled to the school and eagerly awaited the first day of class.


# **On The Road to... Success?**

In my four at Taylor University, I've created a checkers AI, a memorization app, and an HTTP server from scratch. I've designed multiple user interfaces, built and won money for a 3-D rendered animation of Disney's "Small World" Clock, and was even recognized for one of my podcasts created in my sophmore-year audio class. I've also successfully completed two summer internship programs in software development - both of whom asked me to return.

Still, I doubted my choice of major more times than I'd like to admit. Just at the end of my junior year I was despairing my choice of major as I greatly struggled in my data communications class. I realized that I drowning because my teacher wasn't offering any assistance... and the only way I got through any of my previous computer classes was with lots of attention and help from my professors and TAs. *This has never come naturually for me, has it?* I was convinced that I chose the wrong major once more - that I was trying to shove a square peg in a round hole. 

But I believe now, as I'm 3 months away from graduation, that it was the best major for me. Not because I'm quick to understand computer science concepts - trust me, it's always taken me a while to learn something new in this field. Instead, though, the major plays to my strengths in analytical thinking and visual design. And computer science is such a large career field! I can use my current knowledge of coding and computers to accomplish projects in so many areas I'm passionate about - especially in those artistic, creative, and people-driven!

So yes, I somehow made it through a rocky road of becoming a computer scientist. I'm glad I made it here, and I certainly have a long road ahead of me as I learn the field more. But I'm excited to be traveling this road and am eager to see what destinations lie ahead!
