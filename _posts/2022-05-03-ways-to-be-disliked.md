Hey all, recently I've realized that many of the posts or videos that show up in my feed offer advice on how to better communicate or relate to people. It seems like the world is focused on getting others to like and approve of you. While that's all fine and dandy, I want to flip the topic on its head in think, instead, how we might enable ourselves to be hated? Keep reading.

# **Don't give a care**
People want to be seen, heard, and have their name be said. Therefore, you must deny them all of these pleasures and focus on your own good. Think about what you want to say as they're talking. Let your eyes drift around the room to see what others are doing or talking about as someone is trying to explain their day to you. And best yet? Pull out your phone as they're speaking to you! It's hard to find a better way to signal to your peer that you'd rather be thinking about anything other than what they're talking to you about.

# **Talk behind others' backs**
Nothing will sting your friend's heart more than being told that you've been talking smack behind their back. They'll be able to hear what you truly think about them without you needing to be confrontational about it! It's a win-win folks! You avoid any negative reactions or feelings while delivering a low punch to the gut that everyone else is a part of.

# **Make sure you get the best end of the stick**
The world should be a fair place, but when in doubt, it should be most fair to you. Therefore, when your friends are going out for food, make sure that the responsibility of driving and or paying for gas always lands on other people more than you. Make sure you're never unduely spending the most out of your friends so that they're taking advantage of your resources and kindness. Instead, you are practical and stick up for yourself, your bank account, and your ability to have fun while traveling places with others. And this principle pertains to any other aread in life. If anyone must get the short end of the stick, it shouldn't be you. Besides, you need to put yourself and your peaceful state of mind first, right? Your friends will most likely catch onto this mindset and have opposite sentiments. But you are doing what's best for you!

# **Make it all about you**
You're pretty awesome right? Tell others! Explain to them all the cool places you've been, who you out-performed that day, and all the things that make you proud. Others will be sick and tired of your over-inflated ego and probably hate you for it. Perfect, right?

# **Straight up call them out in public**
Nothing is more important to a person than their opinion of themselves. A great way to not let them save face is to staight up call them out in public! Is there something that everyone is thinking about this person, but no one's brave enough to call out the elephant in the room? Do it yourself! This will crush them and grant them countless nights of no sleep, worrying about how long they've been annoying people with the way they are. 


Well friends, that's all the advice I've got for now. More to come soon!
